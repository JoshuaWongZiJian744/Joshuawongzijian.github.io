    <h1>Joshua Wong Zi Jian</h1>
    <h2> Believe you can and you're halfway there.</h2>

    <p>Hello! I’m Joshua Wong, a 19-year-old student at Dasein Academy of Art, where I’m pursuing my passion for art and
        design. I live in Seremban, a place that inspires me with its rich culture and vibrant community.

        I’ve always been fascinated by how art can express emotions and tell stories, and I’m eager to develop my skills
        and explore different mediums. Whether it's drawing, painting, or digital design, I love experimenting and
        pushing my creative boundaries.

        Outside of my studies, I enjoy [mention hobbies or interests, like photography, music, gaming, etc.]. I also
        like to connect with fellow artists and share ideas. I believe that collaboration and feedback are essential for
        growth.

        I’m excited about the journey ahead and look forward to making meaningful connections in the art world!
